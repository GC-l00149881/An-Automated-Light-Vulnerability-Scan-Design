# An-Automated-Light-Vulnerability-Scan-Design
A very simple automated ‘light’ vulnerability scan/scanner design, implementated using the Nmap 7.8 network scanner as a baseline tool and automated with the Python integrated development environment, Pycharm.  Includes 4 script variations.

VulScan1.py, includes 1a simple interactive menu for scan selection comprising host, operating system, port discovery, vuln, vulners and vulscan vulnerability scan options, 2an input field for target selection, 3output control of the scan results for normal output to file and 4an option to quit the vulnerability scan program.

VulScan2.py, includes 1a simple interactive menu for scan selection comprising host, operating system, port discovery, vuln, vulners and vulscan vulnerability scan options, 2the ability to scan multiple targets loaded from a file, 3output control of the scan results for normal output to file and 4an option to quit the vulnerability scan program.

VulScan3.py, includes 1a simple interactive menu for vulnerability scan selection for seven specific vulnerability types, 2an input field for target selection, 3output control of the scan results for normal output to file and 4an option to quit the vulnerability scan program.
